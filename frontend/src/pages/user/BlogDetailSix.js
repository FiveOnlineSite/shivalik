                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p className='mb-1'><strong>Assess Your Finances</strong>Â </p>
                            <p>You should always calculate your financial situation and look for purchasing a property that fits your budget. 
                              While accessing your current financial position, include your income, expenses, and existing debts. Moreover, check for hidden or additional changes the developer may request. 
                              This will be instrumental in judging if you can afford your downpayment and the EMI comfortably.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p className='mb-1'><strong>Research and Choose the Right Property</strong></p>
                            <p className='mb-1'>Research the real estate market in and around Mumbai to find the property that fits your needs, 
                              requirements, and budget. While choosing the property, 
                              look at the area's prospects and if it aligns with your future needs and desires.</p>
                            <p>It is recommended to take a tour of the locality to find out whether there are schools, colleges, hospitals, shopping facilities, parks, and playgrounds.
                                A futuristic perspective is of the utmost importance before buying the property. 
                                If you purchase a new property, ensure that it is RERA-registered. 
                                RERA registration protects you against structural defects for the next five years.</p>

                            <p className='mb-1'><strong>Understand Home Loan Eligibility</strong></p>
                            <p className='mb-1'>Before buying a home, you must be meticulous in checking your loan eligibility. 
                              Check your eligibility for a home loan with various banks or financial institutions. Access your income, 
                              credit score, debts, and repayment capacity so you don't drag yourself into a financial mess.</p>
                            <p className='mb-1'>It is also recommended to compare interest rates, processing fees, 
                              and other terms and conditions from different lenders. 
                              Choose a home loan that suits your financial situation.</p>

                            <p className='mb-1'><strong>Check for ideal Home Loan Tenure</strong></p>
                            <p>Your ideal home loan tenure depends on factors such as interest rate, EMI, expenses, etc. 
                              There is no universal best home loan tenure. A longer-term would mean low monthly 
                              payments but a higher interest rate. Your ideal home loan tenure should be planned 
                              considering your age, loan amount, existing loans, and retirement age.</p>

                            <p className='mb-1'><strong>Look for ways to reduce your home ownership costs</strong></p>
                            <p>Planning your EMIs can help reduce the total home loan interest rate and homeownership cost. 
                              The most effective way to get a low interest rate is by opting for a higher down payment. 
                              Consider increasing your EMI payouts every year to reduce your interest expenses.</p>

                            <p>Other than checking for cheap home loan rates, consider additional costs such as registration 
                              fees, stamp duty, and maintenance charges. 
                              Plan your finances to accommodate these extra expenses while you plan to <Link className='sa-txt' to='/'>buy a home in Mumbai</Link>.</p>

                            <p>There are tax benefits available on home loans. For first-time homebuyers, 
                              you can claim an additional deduction. 
                              These benefits can reduce the overall tax liability of the borrower.</p>
